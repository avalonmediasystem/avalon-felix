# Configuration for the smtp service

# PLEASE NOTE:
# The properties with 'smtp' or 'smtps' in their names only
# apply when such protocol is used. In other words, if the
# value of 'mail.transport.protocol' is set to 'smtp', the
# properties containing 'smpts' in their names will be 
# ignored, and vice-versa.
#
# The properties with no 'smtp' nor 'smtps' in their names,
# when set, apply to both protocols.

# Accepted values are 'smtp' or 'smtps'
